#Tip Calculator

###Notes: At first I thought it would be easier to build the form using Bootstrap. Once I began building the .js file, I realized Bootstrap might not be the best format. For one, it was more difficult to format the event listener when calculating the tip. Also, I wasn't able to put placeholder text in the "How much?" dropdown. My top priority right now is to tackle the underlying javascript before redoing any of the front-end.
